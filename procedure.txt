# Pre-setup

File Explorer:
    Unzip [AX_MMD] zipmod and use it as a base

Unity:
    Start with a KoikatsuModdingTools folder from github
    Top menu, GameObject->Create Empty
    Rename object to `base_3dse`
    In base_3dse -> Add Component -> SE Component (Script)
    Set attributes:
    - Sound Type = Game SE3D = 4
    - Is Loop = disabled = 0
    - Type = Logarithmic = 1
    - Rolloff Distance Min = 5
    - Rolloff Distance Max = 9
    - Volume = 1
    Drag and Drop `base_3dse` into `Assets/3DSE objects` (make that folder)
    Make the folder structure `Assets/Mods/OpenNSFW port - Plaps/Prefab`
    Make the folder structure `Assets/Mods/OpenNSFW port - Plaps/List/Studio/open_nsfw_plaps`
    Make the necessary koikatsu item list csv files in `.../open_nsfw_plaps`

# Compilation

File Explorer:
    Drop sound files folder on kk_sound_file_mod.py

    - Preserve Sample Rate 
    Edit the ItemList.csv file to add the new sound items
    Put the updated ItemList.csv in the [AX_MMD] zipmod base
    Modify `Assets/Editor/GeneratePrefabsFromWav.cs` so that `folderPath` points to the new folder
    Modify `Assets/Editor/GeneratePrefabsFromWav.cs` so that `GetItemName` can extract the number from the sound file name
    Run from the top left menu `Assets->Generate Prefabs From Wav`
    Select all `.prefab` objects in `Assets/Mods/.../Prefab`
    In bottom right `Asset Labels` menu, make New->studio\open_nsfw\name_of_author\name_of_category/sound_name and select `unity3d`
    In Top menu, Window -> AssetBundle Browser -> Build tab
    Enable `Clear Folders` and disable `Compression`
    Press `Build Asset Bundles`
    Transfert the compiled `.unity3d` from `Build/abdata/...` into the [AX_MMD] base
    Zip the [AX_MMD] base with Bandizip using compression = 0 and filename = [AX_MMD] ... .zipmod
