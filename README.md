# Koikatsu OpenNSFW Sound Pack port

This is a port of the [OpenNSFW Sound Pack](https://opennsfw.carrd.co/) as a mod for Koikatsu Studio. The pack contains various types of NSFW sounds from various creators, so I will divide it into multiple mods.

(Only contains `OpenNSFW/Plaps/Squishy (LeHornySFX3D)` as of 2025-01-31, more on the way)

Each sound clip has been adapted into a 3DSE Studio Item to use with Timeline. They can be accessed in Charastudio's menu `Add->Item->3D SFX` or via the search function (`opennsfw`).

In `Add->Item->3D SFX` you will see multiple sub-menus in the following form: 

> Category [Author Name][OpenNSFW]. 

You will also see these tags on each item when using the search function. This should help with credit attribution if you want to publish works, commercial or not, as required by the terms of the [OpenNSFW Sound Pack](https://opennsfw.carrd.co/).
    
Example:

> Plaps [LeHornySFX3D][OpenNSFW]
> Plaps [Author A][OpenNSFW]
> Squirt [Author B][OpenNSFW]
