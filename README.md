# Koikatsu OpenNSFW Sound Pack port

This is a port of the [OpenNSFW Sound Pack](https://opennsfw.carrd.co/) as a mod for Koikatsu Studio. The pack contains various types of NSFW sounds from various creators, so I will divide it in multiple mods.

(Only contains `Plaps/Squishy (LeHornySFX3D)` as of 2025-01-31, more on the way)

Each sound clip has been adapted into a 3DSE Studio Item to use with Timeline. They can be accessed in Charastudio's menu `Add->Item->3D SFX` or via the search function (search "opennsfw").

In `Add->Item->3D SFX` you will see multiple sub-menus in the following form: 

    Category [Author Name][OpenNSFW]. 
You will also see these tags on each item when using the search function. This should help with credit attribution if you want to publish works, commercial or not, as required by the terms of the OpenNSFW Sound Pack.
    
Example:

    Plaps [LeHornySFX3D][OpenNSFW]
    Plaps [Author A][OpenNSFW]
    Squirt [Author B][OpenNSFW]

[OpenNSFW Sound Pack](https://opennsfw.carrd.co/) is a collaborative NSFW sound resource founded with the goal of giving accessible studio quality NSFW
SFX to all content creators at no cost. They only require adherence to the terms documented in [README - OpenNSFW SFX Pack Terms.pdf](https://github.com/AX-MMD/Koikatsu-OpenNSFW-Sound-Pack-port/blob/main/README%20-%20OpenNSFW%20SFX%20Pack%20Terms.pdf) (you can check the link on their homepage for an up-to-date terms document)

In short, the terms and conditions to publish works that use audio content from OpenNSFW Sound Pack are:

* Read the [terms document](https://github.com/AX-MMD/Koikatsu-OpenNSFW-Sound-Pack-port/blob/main/README%20-%20OpenNSFW%20SFX%20Pack%20Terms.pdf) in its entirety (less then 5 easy to read pages as of 2025-01-31).
* Use the audio content in any form of media production, commercial or not, without any requirement to compensate OpenNSFW.
* Don't repack the audio content under a different Sound Pack.
* Include credits when publishing works that use content from OpenNSFW Sound Pack.
